# EdgeDB Deno driver

[![deno land](http://img.shields.io/badge/available%20on-deno.land/x-lightgrey.svg?logo=deno&labelColor=black)](https://deno.land/x/edgedb) [![Build Status](https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-js/workflows/Tests/badge.svg?event=push&branch=master)](https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-js/actions) [![Join GitHub discussions](https://img.shields.io/badge/join-github%20discussions-green)](https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb/discussions)

`edgedb-deno` is the official [EdgeDB](https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb)
driver for Deno. ðŸ¦•

This repo is automatically generated from the source of the `edgedb-js` driver.
For documentation, issues, or details about the development of `edgedb-deno`,
please refer to the [edgedb-js](https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-js) repo.

## Import

```typescript
import * as edgedb from "https://deno.land/x/edgedb/mod.ts";
```

Following Deno convention it is recommended to always import a specific tagged
version of `edgedb-deno`, and to not import from the underscored `/_src` path
(all of `edgedb-deno`'s public API is exported from the `/mod.ts` file).

The `main` branch of this repo mirrors the latest commits to the `master`
branch of [edgedb-js](https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb-js), though it not
recommended to import from this branch directly, as it may contain breaking
changes.

## Quick start

First install EdgeDB, then create and start an EdgeDB instance. The tutorial
in the EdgeDB docs is a good place to get started:
https://www.edgedb.com/docs/tutorial/index/

Now you're ready to import `edgedb-deno` and start querying your database:

```typescript
import * as edgedb from "https://deno.land/x/edgedb/mod.ts";

const conn = await edgedb.connect("tutorial");

console.log(await conn.queryOne("SELECT 1 + <int64>$num", { num: 2 }));

await conn.close();
```

For the full documentation see the
[edgedb-js docs](https://www.edgedb.com/docs/clients/01_js/index).

## TLS

Deno doesn't currently support TLS ALPN for client connections. This means that
to use deno with the latest version of edgedb the server needs to be run
without TLS which is on by default.

## Permissions

The permissions `edgedb-deno` may require are detailed below:

### `--allow-net` (required)

This permission is required to connect to EdgeDB instances.

### `--allow-env` (optional)

Needed if connecting with an instance name, to get your home directory (where
the `.edgedb` directory is located).

### `--allow-read` (optional)

Needed if connecting with an instance name, to read the instance credentials
file from `<home-dir>/.edgedb/credentials`.

## `--unstable` flag

`edgedb-deno` supports connecting to an EdgeDB instance via a unix socket file,
however this currently requires using the `--unstable` flag, and the
`--allow-read` and `--allow-write` permissions for the socket file.
